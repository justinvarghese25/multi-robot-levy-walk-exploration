Multi-Robot Lévy Walk Exploration with Potential Fields

A MATLAB-based simulation of a multi-robot exploration system that combines a modified Lévy walk strategy with potential fields for collision avoidance, dynamic map merging, and object detection in unknown environments.

Features

Multi-Robot Exploration: Cooperative navigation of a bounded 2D map.

Modified Lévy Walk: Balances local and global exploration steps.

Potential Fields: Maintains safe inter-robot distances and avoids obstacles.

Dynamic Map Merging: Combines local occupancy maps into a global representation.

Object Detection: Marks detected objects in the merged map.

Performance: Achieves >90% map coverage in simulation.
